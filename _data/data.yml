    summary: |

      Before working in reasearch and development I was .

education:
    - degree: PhD in Biology
      university: University of Münster
      time: 2001 - 2007
      details: |
        The bacterium *Ralstonia eutropha* is the best studied ‘Knallgas’ bacterium 
        and producer of poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid), commonly abbreviated as PHB. 
        This polyester provides the basis for renewable resource-based biodegradable 
        plastic materials and has attracted much biotechnological interest. 
        During my PhD, the genome sequence of the bacterium was sequenced (using 
        Sanger sequencing). A large portion of the work included primer-walking to 
        close gaps, correctly assembly the two chromosomes and the megaplasmid and 
        to polish the sequence data.
        
        As the number of available reference genomes and automated systems to annotate 
        genes was very limited by that time, I implemented several tools to find and 
        annotate genes, starting on the preliminary contigs from raw sequencing. 
        This work used a central database that was populated running batches of various 
        tools for sequence motif detection and homology searches (Blast). A web-fronted  
        was used to present possible annotations with their level of evidence to allow 
        manual curation and a relative fast, thorough and correct assignment of functions 
        to genomic sequence. 
        
        The final annotated sequence was published in Nature Biotechnology in 2006.

          - Sequencing, assembly, gap-closure, polishing
          - Annotation, batch jobs, database integration, web-frontend for manual curation

    - degree: Diploma in Biology
      university: University of Münster
      time: 1995 - 2001
      details: |
        For my 'Diplom' (Masters equivalent), I have worked with bacteria that store 
        plastic as a source of carbon and energy when growth is limited by a limitation 
        other than carbon source shortage. The thesis (in German) is entitled: "Synthese 
        und Einbau von 3-Hydroxy-4-Pentensäure in Polyhydroxyalkanoate in *Burkholderia cepacia*
        Stamm IPT64" (Diplomarbeit Universität Münster, Fachbereich Biologie, 2001). 
        This was a wet-lab centered work to elucidate the origin of a special building block 
        of the polymers found in some species.

          - Feeding experiments
          - Metabolite measurements (GC, GC/MS, LC, enzyme assays)

experiences:
    - role: Associate Director Bioinformatics
      time: 2015 - Present
      company: QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany
      details: |
        Current responsibilities include development of data analysis pipelines 
        and assay design both for internal research groups as well as customer-facing
        solutions (e.g. QIMERA). 
        
        For internal reasearch projects I work closely with scientists and I am 
        involved in planning experiments to ensure that generated data is suited 
        to address objectives and allos answering of research questions. 
        
        Analysis pipelines for external use enable customers to leverage the full 
        potential of our products by providing an easy to use solution with meaningful reports. 
        Our efforts are often needed as a bridging solution for novel applications until 
        main-stream commvercial software packages (like QIAGEN's CLC Workbenches) have 
        implemented a dedicated analysis module.
        
        Input data mostly consists of NGS raw reads but any type of information can be integrated. 
      
        Assay design is done for both enrichment applications (PCR, SPE) 
        as well as hybridisation probes (FISH). I have established methods and algorithms 
        to balance sensitivity and specificity considering the genomic background.
        
        For customer-facing solutions we run Docker container on Google Compute Engine (GCE), 
        organize code on GitHub (both public and private) and work with many programming 
        languages like Perl, R, Python, SQL, Bash and document formats like Markdown, 
        HTML, CSS, SVG etc.

          - NGS analysis pipelines (QIMERA)
          - Oligo design (SPE, FISH)
          - Docker, GCE, Git, Perl, R, Python, SQL
        

    - role: Senior Scientist
      time: 2010 - 2015
      company: QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany
      details: |
        From the service team I have moved to reasearch and development and also from Sanger to NGS 
        sequencing. Main tasks were ...

          - CNV calling (quandico)
          - Pyrosequencing assay design (still used today)

    - role: Scientist
      time: 2007 - 2010
      company: QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany
      details: |
        My first role at QIAGEN was in the Sequencing Service Department, now named 
        Enterprise Genomics Services. In addition to the usual laboratory managers' tasks 
        (sample reception, planning of lab work, Sanger sequencing, reporting) I have 
        worked on projects with bioinformatics needs, e.g. assembly of BACs. 
        
        During that time I have set up a system for verification of a template by comparison 
        with a known reference sequence. Primers are automatically picked (Primer3) based on 
        the provided reference and stored in an internal primer database for reuse. Protocols 
        for automation of the setup (picking done by robots) and sample-sheets reuquired for 
        sequencing machines are generated automatically. I have developed a set of tools to 
        generate deviation reports (PDF) based on assembled reads.
        
        For a large contract for sequence-based HLA-typing (SBT) many hundreds of samples 
        I have set up a database (MySQL) with a web frontend (Perl CGI, jQuery) to track samples, 
        resources, results and select suitable next primers for haplotype resolution. Final 
        reports for each sample were generated from that database and contained details on staff, 
        equipment used, dates and all material lot numbers (PDF) in a GMP-like fashion.

          - Verification Pipeline (primer picking, lab automation)
          - HLA typing system (database with front-end, reporting)
